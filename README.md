# Wildfire-Detection-System
The Wildfire Detection System uses smoke and heat sensors, solar-powered stations, and wireless/satellite alerts to spot early fires in forests and prairies. Mounted on poles or trees, each unit has detectors, a camera, and a transmitter. Three or more stations triangulate location, direction, and speed, allowing rapid response before fires spread.
